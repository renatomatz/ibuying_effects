Real estate is one of the least liquid assets, known for taking considerable time to sell. This has led to the emergence of iBuyers and their algorithms who price the value of homes, offer home sellers an all-cash offer and resell it in the market. This raises the question of how the presence of iBuyers have impacted the US housing market, specifically its liquidity and price level. To answer this research question, this paper collected county-level data on the US socioeconomic and housing characteristics. Data were drawn from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the US Census Bureau and US Department of Education amongst other origins. The county-level median listing price and time-on-market are analyzed using a combination of simultaneous equation systems and the difference-in-difference approach. This paper found that iBuyers did not have any significant impact on the price levels and time-on-market.
